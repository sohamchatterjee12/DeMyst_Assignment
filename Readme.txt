Steps to run the application:-

1) Make sure Docker for Windows is installed and running on your laptop.

2) Clone the Assignment repository onto your local machine.

3) Go inside the cloned folder and open Windows terminal.

4) Give the command "docker-compose up" . This executes the yaml file to start up all the containers and get the application running.

5) Visit localhost:3000 on your browser to use the app.

Note. We have 4 flask-based services and 1 react app each running on their separate containers and communicating with each other.
